# drupal-learning

## Introduction

- We'll be learning about waterfals
- Uses a waterfall as an analogy (metaphor?) for learning drupal
- Things we will learn:

1. Data (nodes, etc): Uses content types, probably very similar to CPTS in wordpress
2. Modules: akin to plugins?
3. Blocks & Menus:
4. User Permissions
5. Template

## Unit 1: How to be successful in this course.

- General tips:
    - watch videos more than once
    - plan on having 25 minutes per lesson
    - pause + play as necessary

## Unit 2: Introduction to Drupal

- General info about Drupal, such as it's open source, free, etc.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal
- Skipped a lot of this, its a bit of propaganda.

## Unit 3: Install Drupal Locally

- Will probably skip a lot of this as I'm using our drupal learning kit.
- Server requirements appear to be almost identical to WP.
- Composer isn't technically a requirement, but should be treated as such.
- Drupalâ€™s code is split into three main areas: core, contributed and custom.
    - Drupal Core: similar to WP Core. Core files. Don't edit
    - Contributed: Modules and themes found via Drupal.org.
    - Custom: Custom stuff by us or other developers.
- Question: I wonder if the file structure mirrors this?
- `composer.json` vs `composer.lock`: The former is a rough idea of what you'd like to install, the lock file is
  the exact blueprint of all the versions and dependencies installed. Never really knew the difference between them.
- [Guide to composer package versions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md): This seems interesting!  I'll have to read over to read over this.  Maybe it'll explain how to actually update composer dependencies.  I've just kind of winged it in the past.
- [How to install drupal via composer](https://partners.acquiaacademy.com/learn/course/669/play/5314/unit-3-installing-drupal-with-composer)
   - Installing drupal seems pretty complicated.  Definitely refer to this video down the road.

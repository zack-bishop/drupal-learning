# drupal-learning

## Introduction

- We'll be learning about waterfals
- Uses a waterfall as an analogy (metaphor?) for learning drupal
- Things we will learn:

1. Data (nodes, etc): Uses content types, probably very similar to CPTS in wordpress
2. Modules: akin to plugins?
3. Blocks & Menus:
4. User Permissions
5. Template

## Unit 1: How to be successful in this course.

- General tips:
    - watch videos more than once
    - plan on having 25 minutes per lesson
    - pause + play as necessary

## Unit 2: Introduction to Drupal

- General info about Drupal, such as it's open source, free, etc.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal
- Skipped a lot of this, its a bit of propaganda.

## Unit 3: Install Drupal Locally

- Will probably skip a lot of this as I'm using our drupal learning kit.
- Server requirements appear to be almost identical to WP.
- Composer isn't technically a requirement, but should be treated as such.
- Drupalâ€™s code is split into three main areas: core, contributed and custom.
    - Drupal Core: similar to WP Core. Core files. Don't edit
    - Contributed: Modules and themes found via Drupal.org.
    - Custom: Custom stuff by us or other developers.
- Question: I wonder if the file structure mirrors this?
- `composer.json` vs `composer.lock`: The former is a rough idea of what you'd like to install, the lock file is
  the exact blueprint of all the versions and dependencies installed. Never really knew the difference between them.
- [Guide to composer package versions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md): This seems interesting!  I'll have to read over to read over this.  Maybe it'll explain how to actually update composer dependencies.  I've just kind of winged it in the past.
- [How to install drupal via composer](https://partners.acquiaacademy.com/learn/course/669/play/5314/unit-3-installing-drupal-with-composer)
   - Installing drupal seems pretty complicated.  Definitely refer to this video down the road.
- Note: When installing Drupal, you'll have to use update the permissions of `sites/default` and `sites/default/settings.php`
- The user you punch in during the setup is a "super user".  The guy in the video stresses that this is the most important user / most attempted to be hacked user.  I wonder if the "super user" is different than a WP Adminstrator.
- Note: use `drush` for site building activities.  use `composer` to update code.  I wonder if in the past, you could use `drush` to update core?
- How to check which scaffolding is in place: `fin composer show drupal/core-recommended`
  - This checks if you're using the recommended scaffolding or if you're running pure core.
  - Returns the following:

## Unit 4: Preparing our Site for Success - The Drupal Essentials
- User #1 is the super user.  Question: Can the super user ever change?
- Wierd: Drupal has administrative and front-end themes.  
- `node`: every drupal content item is referred to as a "node"
- added content along with lesson.
- Seems straightforward, analogous to WP
- Structure: Different from WP?
  - The "regions" structure reminds of elementor / gutenberg.
  - `Structure -> Block Layout -> Custom Block Library` doesn't exist.  Instead, go to `Content -> Blocks`.
  - The blocks are interesting.  I wonder if these came before / after / in response to Gutenberg / WP Page builders?
- Modules:
  - Core modules - Modules from the Drupal team
  - Contributed modules - Modules from the Drupal community
  - Custom modules - Modules from the development team
  - Note: don't use the blue "Install New Module" button to install modules.  Use composer.
- Role Permissions
  - It's very interesting that Drupal has so few default roles
  - You can see all role permissions from the backend, which is definitely a difference from WP.
- I really dig the Reports tab.  
  - It's nice that you can see all the 404s and junk by default.
  - It's super handy that you can see a log of all the actions taken by the users.
- `Configuration -> Development -> Logging Errors`: How you can enable debugging.
- The `Help` menu contains links to the documentation for all the installed modules?!  That's awesome!

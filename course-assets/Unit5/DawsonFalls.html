		<p>Dawson Falls, also known as Te Rere o Noke, is an 18-meter waterfall, the most popular one at Mt Egmont National Park due to an easy accessibility and its beauty.</p>
		<p>The centerpiece of Egmont National Park is Mount Tarnaki.</p>
		<p>The funny thing about this classically-shaped volcano was that it actually doubled as the iconic Japanese volcano Mt Fuji in the Tom Cruise movie The Last Samurai.</p>

		<p>Dawson Falls is roughly a 1-hour’ drive away from New Plymouth or 2 hours’ from Wanganui. The road surface is always sealed.</p>
		<p>Make your own way to Stratford. From here follow the signs ‘Dawson Falls Visitor Centre’: turn into Celia St which becomes Opunake Rd and follow it for the next 14.5 km. Then turn right into Manaia Rd and follow it for the next 9 km until you reach a huge car park. Last few km is a magnificent road through a forest. Enjoy! Toilets, well-maintained picnic area, the DOC office and café are available at the end of the road (1-3 minutes’ walk from the parking).</p>
		<p>From the car park follow a walking 20-minutes’ return Dawson Falls track which leads to the base of the waterfall. The first part of the track follows the main road (downhill), then it jumps into the forest. Within 5 minutes you reach a tracks’ junction. Here you have a choice: either walk to the upper waterfall’s lookout (5 minutes return) or descend to the waterfall’s base (5-10 minutes return). We highly recommend walking both tracks. The track, which descends to the base, consists of a few stairs which are more or less easy but can be slippery. Return via the same track.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, you can park your car at Manaia Rd (near the sign Dawson Falls track 5 min), in this case, you can save 10 minutes.</p>
		<p>The official topo maps say that this waterfall is 16m high, while the DOC sign says – 18m. The truth is out there =)</p>
		<p>Due to the stairs, the track is not suitable for wheelchairs/kids strollers.</p>

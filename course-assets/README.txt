README.txt

This collection of Assets are to be used in building out the Acquia's Drupal Site Building Waterfall Handbook site, developed by completing Acquia Academy's Drupal Site Builder course.

How to use this collection of files:

1) Open index.html in your browser and then navigate to the appropriate resource for more information about it.

Assets are organized by the Unit in which they are meant to be used. Unit 4, Unit 5, Unit 7, and Unit 9.

Copy / Paste the provided resource text (or HTML if you desire) into your Drupal site.

2) For Drupal file uploads, browse to the respective Unit directory where you will find the asset in the applicable images directory.


Note: the ".ignore" directory does not contain assets relevant to the Waterfall Handbook. It contains files needed for the functioning of
this Asset directory. (i.e. CSS, fonts, banner image and Acquia logo).

Happy learning!
